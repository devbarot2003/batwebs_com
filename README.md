Hello #connections
<br>
Today, at day-3 of machine learning with data science skillboost programme, I learnt,
<br>
Pandas basics which is a library used in data science for some operations like filtering out the null values, labelling the columns in a meaningful way, for visulization like line chart and bar chart and so on.
